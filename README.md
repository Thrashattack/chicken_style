## Do not attempt to dive into this addon code


# Improvements

- Added an interface to award GP to players that commited specific failures
    - A window will popup after the announce of all failures for each boss that we track 
    - The window allows you to set the GP values (Defaults were implemented) and award with each player with a click or award all at once
    - The Addon relies on EPGP addon being installed to perform the commands, if not installed, it will print the commands in the chat
